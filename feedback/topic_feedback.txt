I asked for feedback from Justin Ross, Tyler Smith, and Bryce Marshall.

I received feedback regarding my topic verbally instead of in text form. 
From the beginning I strongly wanted to do my project on my idea of kanji usage but I also approached my classmates with an
idea regarding movie ratings from letterboxd.com and an idea of analyzing videogame sales across different platforms. Happily, my
classmates agreed that my kanji idea was a promising one and that I could get a tier 1 ranking if I executed my plan as I 
described. My main concern with this project idea was that maybe it would fail to meet the standards of being of "general 
interest" but I was assured that Japanese was of broad enough interest to be a valid project.
