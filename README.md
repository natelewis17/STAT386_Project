# STAT386_Project

This is the repository containing the code, data file, and feedback for my STAT 386 project. My project is focused on the usage of kanji characters on Japanese Wikipedia and comparing kanji's frequency on Wikipedia with its frequency across other sources. I hope that by looking at this I'll be able to help learners of Japanese at all levels get a more complete picture of what their focus should be on while studying.

Thank you for looking at my project!
